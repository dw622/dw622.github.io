# 😃 About Me
I am an undergraduate student in Mechanical Engineering at [DGIST](https://www.dgist.ac.kr/), with a strong interest in system-level verification and computational mechanics. I have conducted research on capacitive sensing-based driver monitoring systems and reinforcement learning-based autonomous platforms, focusing on the integration of hardware and software for robust real-world performance. I am particularly interested in combining simulation-driven analysis with physical experimentation to ensure the reliability of intelligent mechanical systems.

My research interests include:
- System Verification
- Computational Mechanics
- Intelligent Control Systems
